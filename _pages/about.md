## About Me

I am a PhD student in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program, majoring in Biological Oceanography. I feel incredibly fortunate to have the opportunity to work with Dr. Greg Britten as my advisor in the [Population and Ecosystem Modeling Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/pemlab/home?authuser=0). Previously, I was an MSc student at the Institute of Biogeochemistry and Pollutant Dynamics at ETH ZÃ¼rich, where I completed my master's thesis in the [Environmental Physics Group](https://up.ethz.ch/) chaired by Prof. Nicolas Gruber. Before my master's, I received my BSc degree from the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am broadly interested in ocean biogeochemistry and the carbon cycle.
