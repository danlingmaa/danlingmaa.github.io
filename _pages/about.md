## About Me

I am an incoming PhD student in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program, majoring in Biological Oceanography. I am extremely fortunate to be advised [Dr. Greg Britten](https://sites.google.com/view/pemlab). I was a MSc student in the Institute of Biogeochemistry and Pollutant Dynamics (IBP) at ETH ZÃ¼rich. I am broadly interested in ocean biogeochemistry and the global carbon cycles.
