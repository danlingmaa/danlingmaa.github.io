## About Me

I am a first-year PhD student in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program, majoring in Biological Oceanography. I feel incredibly fortunate to have the opportunity to work with [Dr. Greg Britten](https://sites.google.com/view/pemlab) as my advisor. I was a MSc student in the Institute of Biogeochemistry and Pollutant Dynamics at ETH ZÃ¼rich. I am broadly interested in ocean biogeochemistry and the global carbon cycle.
