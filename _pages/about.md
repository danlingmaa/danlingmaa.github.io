# About Me

I am a first-year PhD student at Computer Science Department, Stanford University.
I am extremely fortunate to be advised Prof. [Tengyu Ma](https://ai.stanford.edu/~tengyuma/). 
Before that, I studied as an undergraduate at Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University (a.k.a. [Yao class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/)). 
I am broadly interested in reinforcement learning theory, online learning and algorithm design.
